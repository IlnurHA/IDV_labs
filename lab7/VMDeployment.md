# VM Deployment

## VirtualBox Version

version: 7.0.10

## Virtual Machine Deployment

- After installation (on Windows 11), opened VirtualBox

- Pressed button "New"

- Named and provided
 ISO file for Ubuntu (Got it from official website)

- Next VirtualBox asked to configure CPU and RAM parameters.
 I set up CPU for 4 cores and RAM for 2GB

- Next I was asked to create virtual disk. I created for 15 GB.
 (P.S. It is not enough to install Ubuntu, unfortunately)

- After Virtual Box created Vitrual Machine

- I started it and chose option
 "Try or Install Ubuntu" and Ubuntu started

I didn't configure nextwork because,
usually, it is done as much as I needed.
Nonetheless, I checked and it was attached to NAT.
